Reset Output
------------

    RO

The reset output command sets the first 256 LEDs for all outputs to use the 256 area definitions in order, so LED 0 uses area 0, LED 1 uses area 1, and so on. All LEDs are set to use colour matrix 0 and gamma table 0. The remaining 256 LEDs on each output are disabled.
